# Set up your boosted blocks here. Replace the EXAMPLE_BLOCK keys to get started! You can add
# multiple blocks underneath each section and a block can be in multiple sections if you want to add
# multiple effects, this doesn't mean they will work together nicely. Adding velocity to an
# explosion may mean a player will be outside of the explosive range before the effect takes place.
# You can use any material that implements the BlockData interface
