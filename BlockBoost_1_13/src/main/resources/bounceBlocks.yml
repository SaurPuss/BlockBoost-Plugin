#                             -------- Bounce Block Setup --------
# -
# Bounce Blocks are blocks that will increase a player's velocity when a player is on top of it
# while moving. The block specific settings are height and normalize. If normalize is set to true
# the height will determine how many additional blocks the player will be boosted up into the air.
# While normalize is off the effects are somewhat more volatile.
# -
# All blocks in the BoostBlock plugin have the option to add a world and whether or not to include
# said world. If you want this block to be available in all worlds, set the world to global and
# leave include-world on true. If you want to disable this in all just toggle the include to false.
# Adding a specific world name will give you the option to either enable the effect only in that
# world or excluding it there specifically.
# -
# Add a block to your list by using the Bukkit Material name. A block can only appear in a block
# list once! However, you can still combine effects by setting up the same block in multiple Block
# Yaml Configs with their specific effects. Non-Block Materials will be ignored.
# -
# If you don't want to display each valid block creation in the console at plugin start-up and
# reload set the console-message to false.
