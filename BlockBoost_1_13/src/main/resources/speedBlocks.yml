#                             -------- Speed Block Setup --------
# -
# Speed Blocks are blocks that will either multiply a player's current speed with a set duration
# before resetting it back to the default. Or they can add speed on top of the player's current
# speed after which it will be set back to the speed a player had before getting boosted.
# -
# Minecraft default walk speed is 0.2, a player's speed can range from 0.0 to 1.0, any attempts
# to go past 1.0 will automatically cap out at 1.0.
# -
# While a player is on cooldown from any of the Speed Blocks, they can't trigger blocks of a
# different Material. (In the case of Speed Addition Blocks the cooldown matches the full duration!)
# -
# All blocks in the BoostBlock plugin have the option to add a world and whether or not to include
# said world. If you want this block to be available in all worlds, set the world to global and
# leave include-world on true. If you want to disable this in all just toggle the include to false.
# Adding a specific world name will give you the option to either enable the effect only in that
# world or excluding it there specifically.
# -
# Add a block to your list by using the Bukkit Material name. A block can only appear in a block
# list once! However, you can still combine effects by setting up the same block in multiple Block
# Yaml Configs with their specific effects. Non-Block Materials will be ignored.

#                             -------- Speed Multiplier Blocks --------
# -
# The multiplier blocks have a preset default walk speed, which is manipulated by the multiplier
# for the speed boost. Multipliers set lower than 1 will decrease the speed, and higher will
# increase speed. So if default is 0.2 * 1.5 that will result in a 0.3 walk speed for the duration
# listed.
# -
# The cap will make sure the maximum speed never exceeds your set number, even if the boost is
# triggered multiple times before being reset. The duration is set in seconds, after which the
# default walk speed will be reapplied to the player.
# -
# To prevent triggering the multiplier too fast, a cooldown is set up. The cooldown is in ticks
# (20 ticks per second). If set to zero the block will activate 3 times while a player is passing
# over a single block! If you don't want to have consecutive multipliers triggered by one or more
# blocks simply set the cooldown as the duration * 20.
# -
#                             -------- Speed Addition Blocks --------
# -
# Speed additions are added on top of the player's current walk speed. While this effect is active
# the are automatically player on cooldown preventing them from gaining boosts from other Speed
# Blocks. After the duration has passed their walk speed will be set back to the speed they had
# when they received the boost.
# -
# Duration is counted in seconds.
# -
#                                   -------- Warning --------
# -
# The blocks defined in this configuration affect the player's walk speed! This means it can
# interfere with walk speed manipulated by other plugins! If this is happening on your server you
# can also choose to utilize the Potion Blocks instead. Add a speed potion effect instead!
